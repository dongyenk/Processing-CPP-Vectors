# Processing-C++-Vectors

## What this program does
---------------------------
• Accepts user input of integers indefinitely, to be added to a vector

• Handles error messages

• Stops accepting input once user inputs CTRL-Z (End of file on Windows)

• Then displays the sum, integer average & float average of vector elements

• Filters out vector elements depending on size

• Uses sorting algorithm to show vector elements in numerical order

## Files
------------------------
***vector_functions.cpp(** contains most of the code, main.cpp calls functions from this other source file

***vector_functions.hpp*** links these 2 files, and contains function declarations of functions defined in vector_functions.cpp
