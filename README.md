# Processing-C++-Vectors

## What this program does
---------------------------
• Accepts user input of integers indefinitely, to be added to a vector

• Handles error messages

• Stops accepting input once user inputs CTRL-Z (End of file on Windows)

• Then displays the sum, integer average & float average of vector elements

• Filters out vector elements depending on size

• Uses sorting algorithm to show vector elements in numerical order

## Files
------------------------
***main.cpp*** calls functions from vector_functions.cpp. This source file prompts the program to run.

***vector_functions.cpp*** contains most of the code 

***vector_functions.hpp*** links these 2 files, and contains function declarations of functions defined in vector_functions.cpp

## Other Information
-----------------------
I learned about C++ vectors from my personal study. Arrays are static containers because their size if fixed once they're created. Vectors are dynamic containers because they grow and shrink as elements are added or removed.
