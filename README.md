# Processing-C++-Vectors

## Basic Processing

The basic processing folder contains a program that allows the user to input integers to be added to a vector.

The program handles error messages and calculates the sum, integer average, float average of vector elements, and it can filter vector elements depending on their size.

It exits and displays processed information when end of file is encountered. On Windows, CTRL & Z input is treated as end of file.

I knew about arrays, and I learned about vectors in my self study. I learned that while arrays are static, because their sizes are fixed after creation, vectors are dynamic, because they grow and shrink as elements are added or removed.
