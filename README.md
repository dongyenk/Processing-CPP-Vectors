# Processing-C-Vectors

The basic processing folder contains a program that allows the user to input integers to be added to a vector.

The program handles error messages and calculates the sum, integer average, float average of vector elements, and it can filter vector elements depending on their size.

It exits and displays processed information when end of file is encountered. On Windows, CTRL & Z input is treated as end of file.
